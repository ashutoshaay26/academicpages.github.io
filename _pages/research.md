* **Correlated discrete data generation using adversarial training** 
Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have shown great promise in tasks like synthetic image generation, image inpainting, style 
transfer, and anomaly detection. However, generating discrete data is a challenge. This project presents an adversarial training 
based correlated discrete data (CDD) generation model, with a detailed approach for conditional CDD generation. Results are 
presented over two datasets; job-seeking candidates skill set (private dataset) and MNIST (public dataset). This project proves 
that the new model performs better than the existing model, as former leverages the inherent correlation in the data, while the 
latter overlooks correlation.

* **Human capital management system**
Finding meaningful and fulfilling work and finding right talent for a given job is a challenging Human Capital Management (HCM) 
problem. Seeking meaningful and fulfilling work and finding the right talent for a given job is a classical Human Capital 
Management (HCM) problem. This project creates a stateless scalable architecture for an automated HCM system, where algorithms 
that use Machine Learning techniques aid in clustering and categorizing job postings and candidate profiles. While Natural Language
Processing based algorithm is used for feature extraction, a ranking algorithm that uses semantic web technologies provides 
accurate recommendations.
